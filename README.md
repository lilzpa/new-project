<p>The question at hand is: can a machine identify a bee as a honey bee or a bumble bee? These bees have different <a href="http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/faqs/honeybees-vs-bumblebees/">behaviors and appearances</a>, but given the variety of backgrounds, positions, and image resolutions it can be a challenge for machines to tell them apart.</p>
<p>Being able to identify bee species from images is a task that ultimately would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. Pollinating bees have critical roles in both ecology and agriculture, and diseases like <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/07/pesticide-found-in-70-percent-of-massachusetts-honey-samples/">colony collapse disorder</a> threaten these species. Identifying different species of bees in the wild means that we can better understand the prevalence and growth of these important insects.</p>

<p>This notebook walks through loading and processing images. After loading and processing these images, they will be ready for building models that can automatically detect honeybees and bumblebees.</p>
