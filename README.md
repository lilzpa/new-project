<p>The question at hand is: can a machine identify a bee as a honey bee or a bumble bee? These bees have different <a href="http://bumblebeeconservation.org/about-bees/faqs/honeybees-vs-bumblebees/">behaviors and appearances</a>, but given the variety of backgrounds, positions, and image resolutions it can be a challenge for machines to tell them apart.</p>
<p>Being able to identify bee species from images is a task that ultimately would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. Pollinating bees have critical roles in both ecology and agriculture, and diseases like <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/07/pesticide-found-in-70-percent-of-massachusetts-honey-samples/">colony collapse disorder</a> threaten these species. Identifying different species of bees in the wild means that we can better understand the prevalence and growth of these important insects.</p>

<p>This notebook walks through loading and processing images. After loading and processing these images, they will be ready for building models that can automatically detect honeybees and bumblebees.</p>

## Conclusion
<p>Machine Learning (ML) has become one of most widely used AI techniques for several companies, institutions and individuals who are in the business of automation. This is because of considerable improvements in the access to data and increases in computational power, which allow practitioners to achieve meaningful results across several areas.

Today, when it comes to image data, ML algorithms can interpret images the same way our brains do. These are used almost everywhere, right from face recognition while capturing images on our smartphones, automating tedious manual work, self-driving cars and everything in between.

In this blog, we'll be deep-diving into machine learning image processing fundamentals and discuss various technologies that we could leverage to build state-of-the-art algorithms on image data.</p>
